## Aim
To code Matlab program to compute convolution and correlation operation of two discrete 
time signals.

## Theory

- Convolution: 

Convolution is a mathematical way of combining two signals to form a third signal. It is the 
single most important technique in Digital Signal Processing. Using the strategy of impulse 
decomposition, systems are described by a signal called the impulse response. Convolution is 
important because it relates the three signals of interest: the input signal, the output signal, and 
the impulse response.

- Correlation:

In general, correlation describes the mutual relationship which exists between two or more 
things. The same definition holds good even in the case of signals. That is, correlation 
between signals indicates the measure up to which the given signal resembles another signals.
In other words, if we want to know how much similarity exists between the signals 1 and 2, 
then we need to find out the correlation of Signal 1 with respect to Signal 2 or vice versa.

## Output

Signal After convolution is  
     4     9     0     8     8    -5  

Verifying the result with inbuilt function we get  
     4     9     0     8     8    -5  

Signal After correlation is  
     5    12     0     4     7    -4  

Verifying the result with inbuilt function we get  
    5.0000   12.0000    0.0000    4.0000    7.0000   -4.0000   -0.0000
