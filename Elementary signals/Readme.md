## Aim
To code Matlab program to generate elementary discrete time signals.

## Theory
A discrete signal or discrete-time signal is a time series consisting of a sequence of quantities. Unlike a continuous-time signal, a discrete-time signal is not a function of a continuous argument; however, it may have been obtained by sampling from a continuous-time signal.
A discrete-time system admits an input sequence x[n] to generate an output sequence y[n] which desirable properties. 
In many applications the discrete-time system is a single-input single-output system.   
Unit step Function:
The unit step function and the impulse function are considered to be fundamental function. The unit step function, also known as the Heaviside function, is defined as such:
 
#### Ramp signal 
The ramp function is a unary real function, whose graph is shaped like a ramp. In machine learning, it is commonly known as the rectifier used in rectified linear units (ReLUs). It can be expressed by numerous definitions, for example "0 for negative inputs, output equals input for non-negative inputs". The term "ramp" can also be used for other functions obtained by scaling and shifting, and the function in this article is the unit ramp function (slope 1, starting at 0).
