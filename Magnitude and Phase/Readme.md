## Aim
To code Matlab program to plot magnitude and phase spectrum of discrete time signal.
 
## Theory

The magnitude spectrum of a filter is equal to the magnitude of the filter's transfer function. Whereas by the common words, the phase spectrum shows the phase shifts between signals with different frequencies.
