## Aim
To calculate z-transform of a signal using Matlab.

## Theory
In mathematics and signal processing, the Z-transform converts a discrete-time signal, which is a sequence of real or complex numbers, into a complex frequency-domain representation. It can be considered as a discrete-time equivalent of the Laplace transform.
Some applications of Z-transform includes solutions of some kinds of linear difference equations and analysis of linear shift-invariant systems.
